# Session Report — 2026-06-23 15:25:55 — feature/data-analysis-agent-v0.1

## Goal

Formalize the hand-rolled "tools-as-data" registry as the real Model Context Protocol: each
uploaded CSV becomes an in-process MCP server (official `mcp` SDK 1.28.0) wrapping its Parquet
file via DuckDB; the agent talks to those servers as an MCP client.

## Phase

Phase 0 — Spec sync + dependency spike (precedes the 3 implementation phases in the approved plan).

## Session Start State

- Branch: feature/data-analysis-agent-v0.1 (pushed; no PR yet)
- Last commit: be37336 refactor: modularise codebase — one responsibility per file, methods <=25 lines
- Tests: assumed passing (will confirm at each gate)
- Untracked, unrelated: handbook.docx, handbook.md, screenshots/ — NOT part of this work, never staged.

## Approved Plan

`/Users/tamo/.claude/plans/jaunty-sleeping-dusk.md`. Locked decisions: in-process in-memory MCP
transport; one MCP server per data source; DuckDB over Parquet; official MCP SDK only
(no langchain-mcp-adapters); spec-first then full migration in 4 phases.

## Steps Completed

- [x] Read full spec manifest + current code (architecture, agent-graph, tool registry, execution, ingester, nodes, datasources)
- [x] Researched official MCP Python SDK 1.28.0 (FastMCP, ClientSession, in-memory transport, structuredContent)
- [x] Confirmed async/sync boundary: sync pipeline on a daemon thread → run_pipeline owns one asyncio.run loop
- [x] Verified env: langgraph 1.2.5, anyio 4.13.0; mcp/duckdb absent; alembic head 57cfed820d74
- [x] Wrote + got approval on the implementation plan
- [x] Opened this session report
- [x] Phase 0: rewrote specs for MCP/DuckDB (vision, architecture, data-model, agent-graph, api, capabilities 00/01/02, tech-stack)
- [x] Phase 0: added `mcp==1.28.0` + `duckdb>=1.1,<2` (installed mcp 1.28.0, duckdb 1.5.4); `uv sync` ok
- [x] Phase 0: spike PASSED — see findings below

### Phase 0 spike findings (de-risked the design)

- In-memory helper `create_connected_server_and_client_session(FastMCP)` yields an **already-initialized** session (no manual `initialize()`).
- FastMCP **auto-generates `inputSchema`** from `run_query(query: str)`: `{"properties":{"query":{"title":"Query","type":"string"}},"required":["query"],...}`.
- DuckDB over Parquet works; native `STDDEV`/`MEDIAN` confirmed → custom SQLite aggregates can be deleted.
- **A raised `ValueError` inside the tool → `CallToolResult.isError=True`** (text prefixed `"Error executing tool run_query: ..."`), NOT propagated across the transport. So recoverable errors = raise; no sentinel fallback needed.
- Bad SQL → DuckDB binder error → `isError=True` (recoverable, with candidate-binding hints).
- **Impl notes for later phases:** (1) version guard must use `importlib.metadata.version("mcp")` — there is no `mcp.__version__`; (2) DuckDB DDL rejects bind params — inline the (escaped) Parquet path in `CREATE VIEW ... read_parquet('...')`; (3) `structuredContent` auto-populates as `{"result": <csv str>}`; we read `content[0].text`.

### Phase 1 — Data model + migration + registration (DONE, gate green)

- Dropped `ToolRow`/`ToolCapabilityRow` (db) and `Tool`/`ToolCapability` (domain); added `tool_description`/`capability_description` columns to `DataSourceRow`.
- Alembic migration `b8e1f0a2c3d4` (down_revision `57cfed820d74`): add cols → back-fill from old tables → drop `tool_capabilities` + `tools`. Reversible downgrade recreates + restores. **Round-trip verified** (upgrade head / downgrade -1 / upgrade head on a temp DB).
- `api/datasources.py`: upload/sync now write the two description columns; delete no longer touches tool tables; removed `_register_tool`/`_build_capability`/`_apply_descriptions`/`_delete_tools` + unused imports.
- `graph/tool_registry.py`: Phase-1 **shim** — synthesises the legacy nested tool dict from the description columns so the existing sync SQLite pipeline still answers queries unchanged (removed in Phase 3).
- Tests updated (drop tool/cap tests, add description-column test, fixture sets description cols). **`uv run pytest` = 20 passed** (incl. golden path + direct `run_pipeline`). Imports clean.
- Deferred to Phase 3: dead `{% if tool %}` block in `datasource.html` (confirmed never rendered — no route passes `tool`).

## Prompt Log

| Time | User Message | Action Taken |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| 15:0x | "Rethink the codebase from MCP stack; tools are MCP clients; CSV upload creates an internal MCP server wrapping the Parquet; use official MCP SDK only." | Explored code + SDK, planned the migration, got plan approved, started Phase 0. |

---

## Decisions Made

- Tool-call format switches to MCP-native `{"tool","arguments"}` (was `{"capability","parameters"}`) — flagged in plan, approved.
- MCP Tool flattens the old two-level Tool→Capability; `tools`/`tool_capabilities` tables dropped; LLM descriptions move to `data_sources` columns.
- In-memory helper `create_connected_server_and_client_session` is semi-public → isolated behind `graph/mcp_pool.py`; `mcp==1.28.0` pinned exactly.

## Future Improvements

- Optional Phase 4 polish: settings-driven row cap, structlog fields for MCP open/close, README architecture diagram, version guard hardening.
- Pre-existing spec/code drift (tech-stack says google-genai; code uses openai/OpenRouter) — out of scope here.
