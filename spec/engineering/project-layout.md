# Project Layout — Canonical Structure

All agents built from this boilerplate follow this layout exactly. The files below (`settings.py`,
`session.py`, `models.py`, `graph/*`, `api/*`, `conftest.py`, `test_pipeline.py`) are standard
FastAPI/SQLAlchemy/LangGraph shapes — generate them idiomatically from this tree and the rules below.
The one exception is `alembic/script.py.mako`, which nothing generates — it's given verbatim under
§ Phase 1.

---

## The repo root IS the agent project

There is **no `<agent-slug>/` wrapper**. Boilerplate files (`spec/`, `reports/`, `.github/`,
`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`) coexist with project files at the repo root.

**Backend/agent source lives inside `src/`; the UI lives in `frontend/`.** Never place loose HTML, CSS,
JavaScript, Python packages, templates, or data files directly at the repo root. The root is for
project-level config only (`pyproject.toml`, `alembic.ini`, `README.md`, `.env.example`) plus the
preserved boilerplate. The one self-contained sub-project at the root is **`frontend/`** — the Node.js
UI (Next.js + React + Tailwind), a Phase-1 deliverable when the product has a user-facing surface
([`ui-and-design.md`](ui-and-design.md)); it is built as a static export and **served by the app so the
whole product runs on one port/command**. If you're about to create a stray application file at the
root, stop and put it in `src/` (backend) or `frontend/` (UI) instead.

---

## README Requirements (canonical home — Mandatory)

The README is the first thing a user touches. A wrong README fails the entire build regardless of
whether the code works. Every generated README must:

1. **State "all commands run from the repo root"** as a blockquote or bold warning at the very top.
   The repo root IS the project — there is no subdirectory to `cd` into.
2. **State the exact working directory** at the top of every shell code block. "Run from project root"
   is enough only because the root is the project; never leave it implicit for a nested path.
3. **Prefix every command with the package-manager runner** — for Python + uv, every `alembic`,
   `pytest`, `python` is `uv run …`. Bare commands fail unless the venv is manually activated, which
   users won't do.
4. **Include `uv run alembic current` after `upgrade head`** so the user can verify tables were created
   (blank output = silent failure).
5. **Stay accurate** — every README command is tested before a phase is marked complete (see
   `ai-agents.md` Rule 1). If a command fails, fix the README before claiming the phase is done.

**Critical:** `tests/` is at the repo root — **not** inside `src/`. `pyproject.toml` must set
`testpaths = ["tests"]`.

The `mcp/`, `memory/`, `guardrails/`, and `evals/` directories implement the agentic stack layers —
each is defined once in [`agentic-architecture.md`](agentic-architecture.md) and its pattern doc. They're
part of the raised default baseline, **real in Phase 1**. `retrieval/` (and long-term memory inside
`memory/`) is earns-its-place — create it only when a later phase needs it. Create only the layer dirs
the agent actually uses, per `02-architecture.md` § Agentic stack layers used.

---

## Phase 1 alembic sequence (mandatory, in order)

All commands run from the **repo root** (where `alembic.ini` and `pyproject.toml` live).
`alembic/script.py.mako` must exist first — **create it by hand**; nothing generates it, and
`alembic revision --autogenerate` fails with `FileNotFoundError` without it:

```mako
"""${message}

Revision ID: ${up_revision}
Revises: ${down_revision | comma,n}
Create Date: ${create_date}

"""
from typing import Sequence, Union
from alembic import op
import sqlalchemy as sa
${imports if imports else ""}

revision: str = ${repr(up_revision)}
down_revision: Union[str, None] = ${repr(down_revision)}
branch_labels: Union[str, Sequence[str], None] = ${repr(branch_labels)}
depends_on: Union[str, Sequence[str], None] = ${repr(depends_on)}


def upgrade() -> None:
    ${upgrades if upgrades else "pass"}


def downgrade() -> None:
    ${downgrades if downgrades else "pass"}
```

Then run the sequence:

```bash
# 1. Create alembic/ (env.py, alembic.ini, script.py.mako)
# 2. Define all SQLAlchemy models in src/<package>/db/models.py
# 3. Generate the initial migration (DB must be reachable, DATABASE_URL set):
uv run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "initial"
# 4. Apply it:
uv run alembic upgrade head
# 5. Verify — must show the revision hash, not blank:
uv run alembic current
```

**Phase 1 is not complete until `alembic current` shows a revision.** Blank output means no migration
was applied.

## Rules

1. **Agent code goes in `src/<package>/`** at the repo root — never in a `<agent-slug>/` wrapper, never
   at the root itself.
2. **No repository pattern** — direct SQLAlchemy queries in graph nodes and API handlers.
3. **`graph/` not `agent/`** — directory name matches the canonical convention.
4. **TypedDict state** — not dataclass or Pydantic model.
5. **Tools are pure functions** — `(inputs) → domain model`, no class instantiation.
6. **Prompts are `.md` files** in `<package>/prompts/` — loaded at runtime.
7. **LLM via `init_chat_model`** — construct the model through LangChain's `init_chat_model` behind a
   thin `llm/model.py` accessor; never call a provider SDK directly in nodes, and no bespoke `LLMClient`.
8. **FastAPI response envelope** — every async route returns `ok(data)` or raises `api_error()` (JSON).
9. **Settings singleton** must be resettable via `monkeypatch.setattr(m, "_settings", None)`.
10. **Phase 1 gate runs against the real model** — DB URL set + the provider API key set (locally from
    `.env`, in CI from a secret), with loose assertions; there is no stub/offline path (see `phases.md`
    and `patterns/llm-providers.md`).
