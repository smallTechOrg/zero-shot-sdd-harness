# Project Layout

The repository root holds the four layers plus the `.claude/` adapter and project config.
These conventions are language-neutral at the harness level; Python specifics are noted
where they are the established default.

---

## Where things go

- **All application source code lives in `src/`** — never at the repo root, for every
  stack (backend, frontend, scripts, data pipelines).
- **Tests live in `tests/` at the repo root** — co-located with `src/`, not inside it.
  (Python/pytest convention; stack recipes may vary for other languages.)
- **Runtime output goes to `logs/`** — never committed; gitignored entirely.
- **The spec is the contract** — `src/` conforms to `spec/`, never the reverse.

## Repo skeleton

```
spec/
  features/     FR-NNN.md and CR-NNN.md files — one per request
  rules/         tech-stack.md, code-style.md, and any project overrides
  patterns/      agentic-ai.md, working-with-llms.md, lateral patterns

src/             all application code
  agent/         agent loop, nodes, graph assembly (LangGraph projects)
  api/           HTTP layer (FastAPI routers, request/response models)
  db/            DB models, migrations, session factory
  integrations/  thin clients for external providers (LLM, APIs)
    stubs/       offline stubs — used in Phase 2, replaced in Phase 3+
  ui/            frontend (Next.js or templates)
  config.py      pydantic-settings config, loaded once at startup

tests/           all tests
  unit/          fast, no network, no DB
  integration/   requires DB; automated setup via conftest.py
  e2e/           golden-path smoke tests

logs/            gitignored — runtime/, sessions/, analysis/
harness/         the method — rules/, process/, patterns/
.claude/         thin Claude Code adapter
CLAUDE.md        entry point
README.md        what this project is — overview, setup, usage, config, dev
```

## Python project conventions

These apply to all Python builds using this harness:

- **Package manager:** `uv` — dependencies in `pyproject.toml`
- **Entry point:** `src/__main__.py` — starts the server on port 8001
- **Config:** `src/config.py` using `pydantic-settings`; loaded once, validated at startup
- **DB migrations:** `alembic` — `alembic upgrade head` is the Phase 1 gate command
- **Tests:** `uv run pytest` from the repo root
- **Linting:** `uv run ruff check .`
- **Stubs:** `APPNAME_LLM_PROVIDER=stub` env var enables stub mode; stub mode adds a
  visible banner on every UI page

## Rules

1. Application code in `src/`; tests in `tests/`; never at the root.
2. One concern per module — no god-files.
3. Prompts and templates are data files loaded at runtime, not inlined in code.
4. External services (LLM, DB, APIs) sit behind a thin client in `src/integrations/` —
   never called raw from business logic.
5. The Phase 2 stub phase must run fully offline — no API keys, no network I/O.
6. `README.md` must always be accurate: every command works exactly as written from the
   directory stated.
