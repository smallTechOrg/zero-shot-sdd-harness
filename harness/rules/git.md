# Git Discipline

All git rules that apply to every Claude Code session in this repo, regardless of language or stack.

---

## Branch Model

- **`main` is boilerplate-only — ABSOLUTELY, for a greenfield `/zero-shot-build`.** Nothing built by a
  build run — no application code, no generated feature, no phase output — ever reaches `main`. The
  default branch is reserved for harness/spec/boilerplate improvements only, and those land via a
  *separate, explicitly-reviewed* PR, never as a side effect of merging a build. If you merge a feature
  branch and its `--base` is `main`, you have violated this rule.
  - **Existing-codebase exception:** if this harness was bolted onto a project that already has its own
    long-running default branch and release process, "boilerplate-only" means never bypass that project's
    own branch-protection/release conventions — confirm with the user which branch plays the role of
    `main` here before assuming.
- **The build's PR targets `<base>` (the branch it was cut from), NOT `main`.** Open it with `--base "$base"`
  so the generated app stays isolated on the feature branch and dogfood output never lands on `main`
  unintentionally. A build that merges to `main` without that being the intended target is a failed build
  — revert it (see below).
- **Branch every build from the CURRENT HEAD.** Capture where you are first:
  `base=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)` — call it `<base>` — then `git checkout -b feature/<slug>-v0.1`
  from there. Never `git checkout main` first unless the user explicitly asked you to build from main. A
  build dogfoods the harness version on the branch you are on; branching from `main` when you meant to
  build on top of existing work would silently test the wrong (stale) branch.
- All phase commits go to the feature branch, never to `main` (unless the user has said main is the working branch for this repo).
- If you find yourself on `main` while writing application code you didn't intend to put there, stop
  immediately, create the feature branch, and continue there.
- **Accidental merge to `main`? Revert, don't panic.** If app code reaches `main` unintentionally, fix it
  with `git revert <sha>` (never force-push/rewrite shared history) and push. The feature-branch copy
  remains the canonical source. Document the revert in the PR.

---

## Commit + Push Are One Atomic Action

**Every commit must be pushed immediately.** `git commit` and `git push` are a single atomic action —
never one without the other.

```bash
git commit -m "phase-N: what you did" && git push origin <branch>
```

A commit that is not pushed does not exist as far as the project is concerned. This is not optional and
survives context compression — if you remember only one rule: **commit then push, every time, no
exceptions.**

---

## PR Must Exist Before the First Feature-Branch Commit

After creating the feature branch and pushing the first commit, immediately open a PR — based on
`<base>` (the branch you cut from, captured before `checkout -b`):

```bash
base=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)   # BEFORE checkout -b — this is <base>
git checkout -b feature/<slug>-v0.1
# ... first commit + push ...
gh pr create --base "$base" --head feature/<slug>-v0.1
```

Every subsequent `git push` automatically updates the same PR. Pushing commits without an open PR is
equivalent to committing without pushing: the work is invisible and unreviewable.

---

## Before Every Reply to the User

1. Run `git status`
2. If dirty: commit and push with `git commit -m "..." && git push origin <branch>`
3. Confirm the working tree is clean **and** the branch is pushed before replying

---

## Commit Message Format

```
phase-N: [what you did]
```

Examples:
- `phase-1: add domain models`
- `phase-2: wire the primary user journey end-to-end`
- `harness: add git discipline doc`

The diff shows the *what*. The message answers: *why was this change needed, and what is the outcome?*

---

## Staging Rules

- **Never `git add -A` or `git add .`** — always stage specific files or directories. `-A` sweeps in
  untracked leftovers from prior build attempts (stray packages, abandoned experiments) and poisons the
  commit.
- If a phase needs many files, list them explicitly or stage directories one at a time.
- Run `git diff --staged` before every commit. You are responsible for what you push.

---

## Commit Quality

- **Commits are logical units.** Each commit should be a self-contained, reviewable change. "Fix bug and
  refactor and add feature" is three commits.
- **No commented-out code in commits.** If code is not needed, delete it. Git history preserves it.
- **Never commit secrets** — no API keys, passwords, or tokens in source files. See
  `harness/rules/secret-hygiene.md`. `.env` is the only manual user step and must stay gitignored —
  `.env.example` is committed, `.env` is never staged.
- **Never force-push without explicit user confirmation.**

---

## PR Description

Every PR needs:
- What changed
- Why
- How to verify

Screenshots or test output for UI/behavioural changes.

---

## Phase Gate: Git Checklist

A phase is not complete until:
- [ ] All code for the phase is committed
- [ ] Commit is pushed to the feature branch
- [ ] Working tree is clean (`git status` shows nothing)
- [ ] Phase test-handoff published; for a build, the human has tested and approved the phase

To see phase history: `git log --oneline | grep "phase-"`

---

## Closing a Session

Before ending any session:
- [ ] Working tree is clean (all changes committed and pushed)
- [ ] Branch is up to date with remote
