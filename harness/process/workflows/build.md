# Workflow: Build

`researcher → planner → executor → reviewer → deployer → analyser ↺`

Takes a user brief from zero to a working, reviewed, **user-testable delivery** of the whole
requirement — in **one iteration**, built as **parallel steps**. The pipeline is autonomous
after the one human-touch approval gate.

---

## Vocabulary — iteration vs step (read this first)

These two words used to be conflated; they are now distinct, and the distinction is the whole
point of this workflow.

- **Iteration** = one **end-to-end, user-testable delivery of the entire requirement**. This is
  the unit the *user* accepts. A zero-shot build is normally **one iteration** — you start a
  second only when the user, after testing, adds or changes a requirement. The old plans had
  ~9 "iterations" before the user could test anything; that was the bug. There is **one** user
  acceptance boundary, not nine.
- **Step** = a green-gated ~10–15 min work-unit *inside* an iteration (scaffold, a model, an
  endpoint, a node, a UI page, the wiring). Steps are the **parallel units** — independent steps
  run at once as a swarm. A step is tested and green, but it is **not** a user-acceptance point;
  only the iteration boundary is.

So: the planner slices the one iteration into a step DAG; executors run independent steps in
parallel; the reviewer's full gate + user acceptance happen **once**, when the steps converge
into a testable whole.

---

## The pipeline is a swarm, not a queue

The arrow order above is a *dependency order*. The supervisor **runs it as a swarm**: wherever
steps are independent it spawns parallel executors and gathers at the iteration gate (see
[supervisor.md](../agents/supervisor.md) → Swarm orchestration). In particular:
- intake research probes + `spec/patterns/usage-specs/` reads run concurrently;
- independent **steps run as parallel executors** (separate worktrees / disjoint paths);
- the **frontend is a first-class step** — built alongside its backend data within the same
  iteration, never bolted on at the end;
- review runs **one reviewer per dimension** in parallel; findings merge at the gate.

The **iteration gate is the barrier** — fan steps out, then reconcile into a user-testable whole
before the gate closes. Parallel writers use separate worktrees or disjoint paths; one owner per
file.

## Blackboard — what each stage reads and writes

| Stage      | Reads                            | Writes                                          |
|------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| researcher | user's brief                     | `spec/features/FR-NNN.md`, `spec/rules/`        |
| planner    | `spec/`                          | FR Step Plan (DAG) + seeded tracker rows        |
| executor   | `spec/`, step plan               | `src/`, `tests/`, recipe scaffold, FR tracker   |
| reviewer   | `spec/`, `src/`, `tests/`        | acceptance tests, sign-off, FR tracker          |
| deployer   | `src/`, config                   | local demo running, result, FR tracker          |
| analyser   | `spec/`, `src/`, `logs/`         | `logs/analysis/`, spec amendment proposals      |

Sub-agents share no memory. Coordination is through durable artefacts on disk.

**The FR is the single trackable file.** The planner writes the `## Step Plan` and seeds the
`## Progress Tracker` in `spec/features/FR-NNN.md`; every stage thereafter updates the tracker
row (one per **step**) it touches as control passes back to the supervisor (status + gate-output
ref + sign-off). Reading the FR alone tells anyone where the build stands. The analyser
cross-checks the tracker against `logs/` on each pass — a `gate-green` row with no matching gate
output is drift.

## Stages

### 1. researcher — get the goal right

Runs the **draft-first** intake (`harness/process/agents/researcher.md`) — **one human
round-trip**, not two serial question rounds (that was the slow path: ~10 min to a signed FR):
- **Draft the full FR from the brief first**, filling every field with best-fit defaults and
  marking each non-obvious guess `[ASSUMPTION: …]`. Reserve `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` only for the
  rare architecture-changing unknown that can't be defaulted.
- Writes the FR with **EARS Success Criteria** from the template; picks the stack (DuckDB vs
  SQLite first-class, both local-first) with rationale, all in the draft.
- **One consolidated approval moment**: drafted FR + stack + API-key list + any blocking markers
  batched as ≤4 choices. Approve-or-adjust in a single turn.
- Records which keys are present (boolean) in the session report.

**Pre-code spec gate (reviewer):** before the planner starts, the reviewer checks the FR for
the four requirement-bug classes (wrong level of detail, ambiguity, conflict, incompleteness)
and any unresolved marker. Cheapest place to catch a defect. (See `reviewer.md`.)

**Gate (supervisor):** FR coherent, EARS criteria testable, stack approved, all keys identified,
no open clarification markers. After sign-off the pipeline runs autonomously.

### 2. planner — slice the iteration into a parallel step DAG

Reads the spec and slices the **one iteration** (the whole requirement) into **steps**, where
each step:
- Has one deliverable (describable in one sentence)
- Has one fast gate command (runnable in under 30 seconds)
- Takes ~10–15 minutes of executor work

The plan is a **DAG, not a queue**: mark which steps are **independent** (run in parallel) and
draw the dependency edges for the rest. The goal is the *whole requirement* testable at the end
of this one iteration — scope each capability DOWN to ship it minimally, never drop one to a
"later iteration." The frontend step ships alongside its backend step, not after.

**Always starts with:**
- Step 0: scaffold — `/health` returns 200 (~8 min)
- Step 1: first model + unit test (~12 min)

Writes the full step DAG into the FR's `## Step Plan` section and seeds the `## Progress Tracker`
rows (one per step, status `todo`); a snapshot also goes to the session report (see planner
agent for format). The FR is the source of truth.

### 3. executor — one step at a time, many in parallel

Each executor implements **exactly one step** per invocation. Independent steps run as **parallel
executors** at once (separate worktrees / disjoint paths; one owner per file).

**Step 0 — scaffold, stack-conditional** (the planner names the recipe; see the selection table
in `planner.md`). Copying the *wrong* recipe is exactly how the slow build lost — the recipe must
match the approved stack:

1. Copy the **selected** recipe to the project root (the planner names it):
   - Relational / transactional → `harness/recipes/python-fastapi-sqlite/`
   - Analytics (CSV/Parquet/JSON) → `harness/recipes/python-fastapi-duckdb/`
   - (+ `harness/recipes/frontend-nextjs/` if the FR needs a UI)
2. Replace all `appname` / `APPNAME` occurrences with the project name
3. `uv sync --extra dev` — the slowest scaffold step (network). **Kick it off in the
   background the moment the stack is approved** (during planning) so it's warm before the
   executor needs it; do the `appname` replace and README edits while it runs. Don't serialise
   behind it.
4. Tables are created automatically at startup — `create_tables()` in the lifespan (both
   recipes; no migration step, no Alembic). See [gotchas.md](../../rules/gotchas.md) C-DUCKDB-VIEW.
5. Confirm `curl http://localhost:8001/health` returns 200 with `stub_mode: true`
6. **Update `README.md`** — name, one-line description, prerequisites, exact `uv sync` +
   run quickstart, `.env` setup. README is a Step-0 deliverable, never deferred (C-README).
7. Commit: `step-0: scaffold — /health green`

**Subsequent steps:**
- Write exactly what the step plan says — one model, one endpoint, one node, one tool, one page
- Write the test first (or alongside) — never skip it
- Run the step's fast gate command; show output in session report
- Commit: `step-N: [deliverable]`

**Per-step gate is fast and green; it is not user acceptance.** A step is "done" when its
sub-30s gate passes and the analyser confirms no drift on handoff. The heavy reviewer checklist
and user acceptance happen once, at the iteration boundary (stage 4).

**On blocker:** three attempts, then route to fix workflow — do not hack around it.

**Python conventions:**
- `src/` holds all application code; `tests/` at root
- External calls sit behind a thin client in `src/integrations/`
- Stubs in `src/integrations/stubs/` — the build runs fully offline until the LLM step
- `APPNAME_LLM_PROVIDER=stub` must be the default until the LLM step

### 4. reviewer — guard the goal at the iteration boundary

When the steps converge into a user-testable whole, the reviewer runs the full gate **once**
against the FR — this is the single heavy checkpoint, not a per-step tax.

**The fixed gate checklist** (the planner does not re-invent it; the reviewer runs it).
Every line is pass/fail — the iteration is not deliverable if any applicable line fails:

1. Gate command run, **output shown** in the session report (not "should pass").
2. Tests green against the **production driver**; offline (`…=stub`, no key, no network).
3. Golden-path smoke asserts rendered **content**, not just a 200 status.
4. Live-server: `python -m src` up; `curl /health` + one real page → 200, **exit codes logged**.
5. Stub mode is visibly **banner-labelled** in any UI (C-STUB-BANNER).
6. **No carry-forward defect deferred a second time** — a flagged defect is fixed, not re-noted.
7. Evals pass at threshold (agent-behaviour requirements); README current.
8. Working tree clean and pushed; session report updated.

See [testing.md](../../rules/testing.md) for the full gate law and
[gotchas.md](../../rules/gotchas.md) for the referenced IDs.

### 5. deployer — spin up the user-testable demo

Once the iteration is green, spin up the local demo so the user can test the whole requirement:
- `uv run python -m src`
- Confirm `http://localhost:8001` serves a live response
- Log curl output in session report

Deploy to Render or other targets only when the user explicitly requests it.
Never deploy to production automatically.
Confirm all irreversible actions with the user before proceeding.

### 6. analyser — close the loop

The supervisor invokes the analyser **after every handoff back to it** — after each step
returns, not only at the iteration boundary. Every pass writes a findings file to
`logs/analysis/`; an early-step pass confirms what is present and names what the next step
still owes, so a missing artefact surfaces one handoff later instead of at the gate. The
analyser **decides on the fly** (see analyser.md) — a one-line verdict when clean, a terminal
route when drift is unambiguous.

At each pass, check: does `src/` match the FR? Do logs match `src/`?

| Signal | Action |
|--------|--------|
| spec ≠ src | route back to executor |
| src ≠ logs | route to fix workflow |
| logs ≠ spec | fix src/ or propose spec amendment |
| all agree | continue; at the iteration boundary, surface to user for acceptance |

**Done signal:** the user explicitly accepts the **iteration** (the whole requirement, tested).
Never self-declare done. Spec amendments go to supervisor + user for approval before any change.
