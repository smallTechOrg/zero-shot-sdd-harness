# Workflow: Build

`researcher → planner → executor → reviewer → deployer → analyser ↺`

Takes a user brief from zero to a working, reviewed, locally deployed agent.
Runs as a sequence of **~15-minute iterations** — after each one the system is runnable.
The pipeline is autonomous after the one human-touch approval gate.

---

## The pipeline is a swarm, not a queue

The arrow order above is a *dependency order*. The supervisor **runs it as a swarm**: wherever
work is independent it spawns parallel agents and gathers at the gate (see
[supervisor.md](../agents/supervisor.md) → Swarm orchestration). In particular:
- intake research probes + `usage-specs/` reads run concurrently;
- independent iterations/files run as **parallel executors**;
- the **frontend is a first-class workstream** — built alongside its backend data in the same
  iteration, never bolted on at the end;
- review runs **one reviewer per dimension** in parallel; findings merge at the gate.

Gates are barriers — fan out, then reconcile before the gate closes. Parallel writers use
separate worktrees or disjoint paths; one owner per file.

## Blackboard — what each stage reads and writes

| Stage      | Reads                            | Writes                                          |
|------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| researcher | user's brief                     | `spec/features/FR-NNN.md`, `spec/rules/`        |
| planner    | `spec/`                          | iteration plan (session report)                 |
| executor   | `spec/`, iteration plan          | `src/`, `tests/`, recipe scaffold               |
| reviewer   | `spec/`, `src/`, `tests/`        | acceptance tests, sign-off (session report)     |
| deployer   | `src/`, config                   | local demo running, result (session report)     |
| analyser   | `spec/`, `src/`, `logs/`         | `logs/analysis/`, spec amendment proposals      |

Sub-agents share no memory. Coordination is through durable artefacts on disk.

## Stages

### 1. researcher — get the goal right

Runs the intake script (`harness/process/agents/researcher.md`):
- Round 1: 4 core questions — problem, users, success criteria, constraints
- Round 2: 4 detail questions — integrations, non-goals, data shape, first runnable milestone
- Writes the FR with **EARS Success Criteria** and `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers wherever
  it would otherwise guess; resolves all markers in **one bounded clarify pass**
- Proposes tech stack (DuckDB vs SQLite is first-class, both local-first); user approves
- Collects all API keys before sign-off; records which are present (boolean) in session report
- Writes `spec/features/FR-NNN.md` from template; fills `spec/rules/tech-stack.md`

**Pre-code spec gate (reviewer):** before the planner starts, the reviewer checks the FR for
the four requirement-bug classes (wrong level of detail, ambiguity, conflict, incompleteness)
and any unresolved marker. Cheapest place to catch a defect. (See `reviewer.md`.)

**Gate (supervisor):** FR coherent, EARS criteria testable, stack approved, all keys identified,
no open clarification markers. After sign-off the pipeline runs autonomously.

### 2. planner — slice into 15-minute iterations

Reads the spec and produces an iteration plan where each iteration:
- Has one deliverable (describable in one sentence)
- Has one gate command (runnable in under 30 seconds)
- Takes ~15 minutes of executor work

**Always starts with:**
- Iteration 0: scaffold — `/health` returns 200 (~8 min)
- Iteration 1: first model + migration + unit test (~12 min)

Records the full iteration plan in the session report (see planner agent for format).

### 3. executor — one iteration at a time

Implements exactly one iteration per invocation. No more.

**Iteration 0 steps — stack-conditional** (the planner names the recipe; see the selection
table in `planner.md`). Copying the *wrong* recipe is exactly how the slow build lost — the
recipe must match the approved stack:

1. Copy the **selected** recipe to the project root (the planner names it):
   - Relational / transactional → `harness/recipes/python-fastapi-sqlite/`
   - Analytics (CSV/Parquet/JSON) → `harness/recipes/python-fastapi-duckdb/`
   - (+ `harness/recipes/frontend-nextjs/` if the FR needs a UI)
2. Replace all `appname` / `APPNAME` occurrences with the project name
3. `uv sync --extra dev`
4. Tables are created automatically at startup — `create_tables()` in the lifespan (both
   recipes; no migration step, no Alembic). See [gotchas.md](../../rules/gotchas.md) C-DUCKDB-VIEW.
5. Confirm `curl http://localhost:8001/health` returns 200 with `stub_mode: true`
6. **Update `README.md`** — name, one-line description, prerequisites, exact `uv sync` +
   run quickstart, `.env` setup. README is an Iteration-0 deliverable, never deferred
   (C-README).
7. Commit: `iter-0: scaffold — /health green`

**Subsequent iterations:**
- Write exactly what the iteration plan says — one model, one endpoint, one node, one tool
- Write the test first (or alongside) — never skip it
- Run the gate command; show output in session report
- Commit: `iter-N: [deliverable]`

**On blocker:** three attempts, then route to fix workflow — do not hack around it.

**Python conventions:**
- `src/` holds all application code; `tests/` at root
- External calls sit behind a thin client in `src/integrations/`
- Stubs in `src/integrations/stubs/` — Phase 2 (Iteration 2) runs fully offline
- `APPNAME_LLM_PROVIDER=stub` must be the default until the LLM iteration

### 4. reviewer — guard the goal

Reviews `src/` against the FR after each iteration.

**The fixed gate checklist** (the planner does not re-invent it; the reviewer runs it).
Every line is pass/fail — an iteration that fails any applicable line is not done:

1. Gate command run, **output shown** in the session report (not "should pass").
2. Tests green against the **production driver**; offline (`…=stub`, no key, no network).
3. Golden-path smoke asserts rendered **content**, not just a 200 status.
4. Live-server: `python -m src` up; `curl /health` + one real page → 200, **exit codes logged**.
5. Stub mode is visibly **banner-labelled** in any UI (C-STUB-BANNER).
6. **No carry-forward defect deferred a second time** — a flagged defect is fixed, not re-noted.
7. Evals pass at threshold (agent-behaviour iterations); README current at the final gate.
8. Working tree clean and pushed; session report updated.

See [testing.md](../../rules/testing.md) for the full gate law and
[gotchas.md](../../rules/gotchas.md) for the referenced IDs.

### 5. deployer — ship after Iteration 2

After Iteration 2 (stub agent loop), spin up the local demo:
- `uv run python -m src`
- Confirm `http://localhost:8001` serves a live response
- Log curl output in session report

Deploy to Render or other targets only when the user explicitly requests it.
Never deploy to production automatically.
Confirm all irreversible actions with the user before proceeding.

### 6. analyser — close the loop

After each iteration, check: does `src/` match the FR? Do logs match `src/`?

| Signal | Action |
|--------|--------|
| spec ≠ src | route back to executor |
| src ≠ logs | route to fix workflow |
| logs ≠ spec | fix src/ or propose spec amendment |
| all agree | surface to user for acceptance |

**Done signal:** user explicitly accepts the iteration. Never self-declare done.
Spec amendments go to supervisor + user for approval before any change is made.

## Session report

Each stage appends to `logs/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS-<branch>.md`.
Use the template at `harness/process/templates/SESSION.md`.

Per-stage required fields: stage name + timestamp, decisions, gate output, blockers, what is next.
